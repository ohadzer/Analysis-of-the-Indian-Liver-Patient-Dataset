1. Using confidence intervals I determined features for which I can state with confidence of 95% that the healthy population mean is larger/smaller than the disease population mean.
2. Drew histograms for each numerical feature. I used MLE to plot, on the same figures, fits of the distributions.
3. For each pair of numerical feature, I calculated correlations. For select pairs, with significant correlations, I drew joint plot with marginal histograms and found bivariate normal fits. I drew plots of the bivariate pdfs.
4. I graphically represent significantly correlated in males and females and about healthy vs disease.
5. For each numerical feature I ploted the distribution for this feature against bins of age. In each bin I provided a split violin plot, with different colors for healthy and disease.
